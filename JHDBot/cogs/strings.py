***FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS***

**Can I ping or dm John ?**
Yes, feel free to ping or dm John. His response time depends on how busy he is, but he is a teddy bear, so you will get a response sooner or later.

**Can I ping moderators role/admins ?**
Yes, but only when it is really urgent, otherwise just ping a moderator or admin who is online or active in chat at that time.

**From where can I get a list of ctf's ?**
Use the website `ctftime.org`, or use the `NullCTF bot`.

**Can you please help me get my (INSTA|FB|STEAM...) account back ?**
NO, PLEASE reach out to support of the respective service/social network instead. They're getting paid for it.

**Can I send a DM to anyone in the server ?**
No, please ask that person if they're okay with DMs before sending a DM out of nowhere.

**Is there place where JHD resources are stored ?**
We have a repo into which the JHD_Bot dumps all the resources from `#resources` channel.
link - https://github.com/Fumenoid/JHD_Resources

**Is Shiptoasting channel a NSFW channel ?**
NO !! That channel is only for tech memes and SFW image posting, we have marked that channel NSFW because memes tend to contain explicit language.

**How did you guys build the JHD_bot ? resources ?**
Really thankfull for a guy named `jared`, his youtube tutorials & Discord, `Drillenissen` and `tsu_katana` too, it's a indirect shoutout to them, they don't know about it : P
also `Nullpxl's bot - NullCTF`, I have read it's source code like thrice, it's super cool !
