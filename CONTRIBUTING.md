## Hey there fellow contributer !

#### Alright here are the things you should keep in mind before contributing to the bot.

- ##### You must be a member of JHDiscord, and you should consult a feature with mods/admins before adding it

- ##### Add the new features in a newly created cog.

- ##### Any feature that might kick/ban/change perms or anything along the moderation lines may get rejected if not properly drafted.

- ##### Please go through code once and if we are using a certain name for variable, use them.. for instance veteran variable name is used for veteran role etc etc, it will make our task a bit easy.

  ###### Rules related to it

  1. All variables must have good readable names.
  2. Command must be named relevantly according to the function.
  3. Add command to help menu after creating a new one else the PR might get rejected.
  4. Keep the code organized and comment it properly.

#### Finally here are some current things we need to add to the bot

- ##### Logging
- ##### Ticket System
- ##### Role Menu
- ##### Poll comand
- ##### Youtube webhook
